## What is FakerAPI?

`FakerAPI` is a simple [API](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-an-api-in-english-please-b880a3214a82/) that allows you to quickly generate a large volume of custom/mock data in a variety of formats for use in local development testing, populating databases, etc.. without adding unwanted dependencies to your project.

#### No Tokens, No Keys, NO RATE LIMITS!

Even though FakerAPI utilizes an incredibly large, highly-distributed network of lightning fast servers, **FakerAPI is 100% FREE to use.** There are no tokens, keys, or required authentication to deal with.

Since FakerAPI is still in it's beta stage, it does employ a very loose rate limit to help maximize it's stability and ensure peak performance during bursts of incoming requests. Once the API comes out of the beta stage, the limit will be pushed back even further, and will only exist to prevent malicious actions.
